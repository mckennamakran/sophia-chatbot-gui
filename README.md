## 🌿 What Sophia Is

Sophia is a **human-centered, AI-assisted relapse prevention app** built with Streamlit.

She doesn’t diagnose.  
She doesn’t rush.  
She doesn’t shame.

Sophia exists for the quiet moments —  
when reflection matters more than prediction.

## 🫧 The Experience

Sophia moves slowly, on purpose.

She asks questions one at a time — about:

- emotions & mental load  
- stress, cravings, and self-esteem  
- substance exposure & access  
- environment & support systems  

Then she reflects back:

✨ a **relapse phase**  
✨ a **probability estimate**, framed gently  
✨ a **personalized action plan**

No dashboards screaming at you.  
No clinical coldness.  
Just clarity, care, and grounding.


## 🧠 Quiet Intelligence

Sophia’s intelligence is intentionally **understated**.

She uses:
- 🌲 Random Forest Classifier → patterns, not labels  
- 🌲 Random Forest Regressor → likelihood, not certainty  

If there isn’t enough data, Sophia doesn’t pretend.  
Uncertainty is treated as honesty.

- Pandas & NumPy for data handling  
- scikit-learn for modeling  
- Local CSV storage only  
- No servers. No cloud. No tracking.



## 🔐 Privacy, by Design

Sophia doesn’t watch you.

- ❌ No analytics  
- ❌ No external APIs  
- ❌ No cloud uploads  

All data lives locally in `sophia_dataset.csv`.

Support should never feel invasive.
